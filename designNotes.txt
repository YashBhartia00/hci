2B Milestone: Consolidated Design and Rationale 
Overview 
Our low-fidelity prototype combines a flexible task organization system with multiple views and 
simplified interactions. The design is driven by the principle that tasks are “first-class objects” - 
modifiable, movable, and easy to interact with. The interface supports both list-based and due 
date based organization. Helena’s design reflected structure, nesting, navigation, and easy task 
creation. Max’s idea of icons only tasks inspired a lot of task creation processes. Yash had the 
idea of task representation in multiple ways, leading us to develop tasks as objects that can be 
moved around, leading us to treating them as objects with properties instead of text. 
Primary Views 
List View: Tasks are organized by lists, where each list can be expanded or collapsed. Nested 
tasks reside within each list, this view was inspired by the need for a clear categorization system 
discussed in our initial designs. The nesting was reflected in all of our designs but the final idea 
was based on Helena’s idea with added icons.  
Due Date View: Tasks are displayed chronologically in a calendar-like format, similar to Google 
Calendar. This view allows users to quickly assess their workload based on deadlines. But since 
tasks are objects that can be moved around, Laura (student persona) can move the task by 
dragging to change the deadlines easily.  
Task Representation 
Task as First-Class Objects: Every task is a self-contained object that can be created, 
modified, and moved independently. The tasks are presented with an icon, followed by the task 
name, all enclosed in a rounded boundary. This presentation enables clear visual separation 
and visual prioritization even when multiple tasks appear on a single line. Taking inspiration 
from Max’s initial approach of using only icons and Yash’s idea of combining icons with text. 
Letting the user (most likely Stacy, casual persona) create very small task names or just use 
icons as tasks. 
 
Interaction: Clicking on a task’s icon immediately crosses it out, providing instant visual 
feedback.  Tasks can be easily reorganized within or across lists via drag-and-drop. This reflects 
our decision to treat tasks as independent objects (further explained in task creation and 
modification).  
Top Navigation and Action Elements 
History (Delete) Button: Tasks dragged onto the delete button (which doubles as a history 
icon) are removed from the active list but retained in a history log for potential recovery. This 
concept mirrors a computer’s recycle bin and was refined through team discussions. T To delete 
a task, users simply drag it onto the icon. To recover deleted tasks, they can click the bin icon, 
prompting a pop-up displaying the deleted tasks. 
Filter Button: A dedicated filter button opens a pop-up that allows users to refine their task view 
by due date, list, priority, and more.  
View Switcher: Centrally located at the top of the interface, this control allows users to easily 
switch between the List View and Due Date View. This solution came from extensive debates 
over screen real estate, with the team agreeing that a minimal yet functional navigation system 
was optimal. 
Floating Action Button: Positioned at the bottom-right corner, the floating action button is 
designed to be unobtrusive while remaining easily accessible. A single tap opens a 
bottom-sheet for quick creation of a new task, whereas a long press provides the option to 
create a new list.  
Task Creation & Modification 
Bottom-Sheet Creation Panel: The panel slides up from the bottom when creating or editing a 
task. It includes fields for Task Name, Icon Selection, and Date/Time Picker. This design draws 
inspiration from Google Tasks and ensures that users maintain context by keeping the main 
interface visible during the process. 
Drag-and-Drop List Organization: Users can immediately drag a newly created task into the 
desired list, addressing user feedback about the difficulties of reorganizing tasks across multiple 
screens. 
Quick Task Creation: For users who prefer minimal input, a task can be created with just an 
icon and later organized into a list. This fast-track creation method supports users who work with 
minimalist or symbolic task representations.  
Addressing User and Task Constraints 
Laura (Busy Student): 
●  Urgent tasks are easily recognizable with red indicators. 
●  The icon-plus-text approach allows detailed task descriptions. 
●  Flexible drag-and-drop functionality accommodates shifting deadlines.  
Mark (Professional with Multiple Lists): 
●  Multiple lists are seamlessly managed with easy switching between views. 
●  Drag-and-drop reordering helps maintain productivity. 
●  Color-coding by due date simplifies priority management.  
Stacy (Home-Based User with Simpler Tasks): 
●  Minimalist task creation (icon-only option) caters to users who prefer simplicity. 
●  The bottom-sheet creation panel is less intimidating and keeps the interface uncluttered. 
●  Overall design supports quick interactions without overwhelming details.
